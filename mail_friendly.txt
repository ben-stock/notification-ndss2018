Hello,

I am a security researcher at the Center for IT-Security, Privacy and Accountability at Saarland University, Germany.

I have found a vulnerability in your site domain.com. I would like to disclose the vulnerability to the correct contact. Could you please point me to that person or confirm that this is you?

Thank you and best regards,
 Ben
